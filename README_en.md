## Prerequisites

1. **Conda** installed (Miniconda / Anaconda)  
2. **OpenFOAM‑10** installed and sourced (`source $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc`)  
3. Repository root contains:  
   - `environment.yml`  
   - `requirements.txt`  
   - `MetaGPT/` (local source)  
   - `active_subspaces/` (local source)  
   - `MetaOpenFOAM/` (MetaOpenFOAM source)  
   - `install_metaopenfoam.sh` (installation script)

---

## One‑Click Install

```bash
# 1. Grant execute permission
chmod +x install_metaopenfoam.sh

# 2. Run the installer
./install_metaopenfoam.sh
```

This script will:

- Create & activate a Conda env at `./metaopenfoam_env`  
- Install all Python dependencies (including local MetaGPT & active_subspaces)  
- Add `MetaOpenFOAM/` to `PYTHONPATH`  
- Build and compile MetaOpenFOAM  

---

## Usage

### Activate Environment

```bash
conda activate ./metaopenfoam_env
```

### Activate OpenFOAM

```bash
source $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc
```

### Configure Inputs

Edit `inputs/config.yaml` with your case settings:

```yaml
usr_requirement: >-
  do a RANS simulation of buoyantCavity using buoyantFoam, which
  investigates natural convection in a heat cavity with a temperature
  difference of 20K between the hot and cold walls; remaining patches
  are adiabatic. Case name: Buoyant_Cavity

max_loop:    10
temperature: 0.0
batchsize:   10
searchdocs:  2
run_times:   1

MetaGPT_PATH:    "MetaGPT/"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: "YOUR_DEEPSEEK_KEY"
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL:"https://api.deepseek.com"
model:           "deepseek-chat"

# —— Optional: Uncomment for OpenAI model —— 
# OPENAI_API_KEY:    "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
# OPENAI_PROXY:      "http://127.0.0.1:8118"
# OPENAI_BASE_URL:   "https://api.openai-proxy.com/v1"
# model:            "gpt-4o"
```

> **Note**: Supports `openai` and `deepseek` models. Default uses HuggingFace Embedding; switch to OpenAI for the embedding method in the paper.

### Edit Makefile

In the project root `Makefile`, adjust:

```makefile
# Python interpreter (e.g. python3)
PYTHON     = python

# Input case name (matches filename in inputs/, without extension)
Case_input = Buoyant_Cavity
```

### First Run

```bash
make
```

- Initializes the database  
- Builds the project  

### Run Main Program

```bash
make run_main
```

## FAQ

- **Script failed halfway—how to retry?**  
  Re-run `./install_metaopenfoam.sh`. It skips completed steps and finishes the rest.
